## Inspiration
I've spent a lot of time chatting with one another and what do we use to express our feeling? emoji...😃 
yes, we decided to make a filter with emoji and anime 😝 .  


## What it does
So, you can either open the rear camera or front camera.. the first thing you would see is a custom instruction saying smile. as soon as you smile😃 you will see some anime blush and lots of emoji's floating in the air. 😎
well only smile.... you can also share various emotions with this filter... like your anger 😠.. when you will make an angry face it will show you angry emoji with angry anime characteristics on your face. also, you can make a surprising face it will show a floating surprised emoji with characteristics of surprised anime on your face.😯 all these faces have a different background attached to it.
## How we built it
Firstly we made a small storyboard regarding the filter, then we collected assets .. collecting emoji's png and using them in particle emitter was quite easy, then we searched other useful assets for the project like background and went through many anime, posters to decide what should we add to face. then In spark ar, we used a face tracker to detect various faces like a smile, surprised face,  to add various background and face assets to the user's face. 


## Challenges we ran into
well, it was quite difficult to use the patch editor, we have used too many things in the project the patch editor have become quite messy.
Also detecting an angry face was not easy, so we came up with an easy idea of using eyebrows lowered as a sign of having an angry face.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we’re most proud of is the fact that we worked together as a team so effectively despite being separated due to COVID. This was really the first time anyone of us had worked collaboratively on a big project like this. Learning to use GitHub to make sure all of our additions merged smoothly was a huge learning curve, but we stuck it out and we were all able to flex our developer's muscles.

We also worked hard doing a detailed reading of the documentation, as there are few Spark AR Studio tutorials to be found online due to it being such a new technology, especially regarding advanced scripting. 


## What we learned

First and foremost we learned how to use SparkAR altogether. This was our first time using such a tool. We learned all about patch editor. But most of all we learned that teamwork really does make the dream work. Or, maybe it was just tremendous amounts of caffeine.

## What's next for Enime
Well, we have planned to make this filter even bigger, we would be adding support for more facial expression, so more people can express them self as anime and emojis.
